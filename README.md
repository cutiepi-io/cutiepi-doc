# CutiePi tablet - User Manual

CutiePi tablet is a 100% open source Raspberry Pi 4 tablet powered by the Compute Module 4. It has a 5000mAh li-po battery, an 8 inch multi-touch display with 1280 x 800 resolution, and a handle that also doubles as a stand.

The tablet also has a built-in gyroscope, a rear-view camera, a microphone and a speaker, you can simply carry or use it like your everyday gadgets.

## Before You Begin 

- Charge your CutiePi after unboxing - Make sure you're using a regular `5V 3A` power supply, as some fast charger for phones might not work
- Update your SD card - Follow the [System Flasing Guide](https://github.com/cutiepi-io/cutiepi-doc/blob/main/SystemFlashingGuide.md) to download and flash the latest system

## How to Get Started

### Turning CutiePi On / Off

- Power On: Press and hold for `3s` till the backlight turns on, release the power button 
- Sleep/Wake: Short press on the power button 
- Force Shutdown: Press and hold the power button for `10s` till the backlight turns off 

When in doubt of the hardware status, we recommend to do the power cycle: force shutdown (press and hold for 10s), release, then power on. 

### Mind the Heat 

Do not be alarmed if the back of the CutiePi gets hot: 

- This is by design. This means that the heat sink is doing its job 
- If you wish, you may cool down CutiePi by by adjusting the `Power Mode` in the Settings

### In Case of Software Upgrade 

Just like Raspberry Pi, the CutiePi's OS runs on a micro SD card: 

- The SD card slot is located in the lower right corner of the device 
- It is spring loaded, and can be released with a gentle push 
- Insert the card face down
