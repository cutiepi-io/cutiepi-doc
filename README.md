### Software and Hardware 

CutiePi tablet's operating system is running off the micro SD card, just like the Raspberry Pi. 

- The card socket is located at the bottom right corner of the device
- It's spring loaded, a gentle push would release it 
- Insert it back with the card facing down

### Passive Heat Dissipation

- Do not be alarmed if and when CutiePi gets hot at the back
- This is by design, and is the expected behavior with the heat sink
- To make CutiePi run cooler, you may lower the deviceâ€™s power consumption by adjusting `Power Mode` in the Settings
