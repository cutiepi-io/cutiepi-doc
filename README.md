### Mind the Heat 

Do not be alarmed if the back of the CutiePi gets hot:

- If you wish, you may cool down CutiePi by by adjusting the `Power Mode` in the Settings

### In Case of Software Upgrade 

Just like Raspberry Pi, the CutiePi's OS runs on a micro SD card:

- It is spring loaded, and can be released with a gentle push 
- Insert the card face down
