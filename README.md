### Turning CutiePi On / Off

- Power On: Press and hold for 3s 
- Sleep/Wake: Short press
- Force Shutdown: Press and hold for 10s 

Please make sure the display is completely turned off after it was shutting down, otherwise it may drain the battery. 

### Mind the Heat 

Do not be alarmed if the back of the CutiePi gets hot: 

- This is by design. This means that the heat sink is doing its job 
- If you wish, you may cool down CutiePi by by adjusting the `Power Mode` in the Settings

### In Case of Software Upgrade 

Just like Raspberry Pi, the CutiePi's OS runs on a micro SD card: 

- The SD card slot is located in the lower right corner of the device 
- It is spring loaded, and can be released with a gentle push 
- Insert the card face down 

You can find more information in [System Flashing](SystemFlashingGuide.md) guide.
